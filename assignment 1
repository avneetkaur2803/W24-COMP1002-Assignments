    <h1> OK NOT TO BE OKAY </h1>
    <h2> By Marshmello and Demi Lovato  </h2>

        <p>Feeling like a drop in the ocean
        That don't nobody notice
        Maybe it's all just in your head
        Feeling like you're trapped in your own skin
        And now your body's frozen
        Broken down, you've got nothing left.</p>

       <p> When you're high on emotion
        And you're losing your focus
        And you feel too exhausted to pray
        Don't get lost in the moment
        Or give up when you're closest
        All you need is somebody to say
        It's okay not to be okay
        It's okay not to be okay
        When you're down and you feel ashamed
        It's okay not to be okay .</p>

        <p>Feeling like your life's an illusion
        And lately, you're secluded
        Thinking you'll never get your chance
        Feeling like you got no solution . 
        It's only 'cause you're human
        No control, it's out of your hands . </p>
        
        <p>When you're high on emotion
        And you're losing your focus
        And you feel too exhausted to pray
        Don't get lost in the moment
        Or give up when you're closest
        All you need is somebody to say
        It's okay not to be okay
        It's okay not to be okay
        When you're down and you feel ashamed
        It's okay not to be okay
        When you're high on emotion
        And you're losing your focus
        And you feel too exhausted to pray
        Don't get lost in the moment
        Or give up when you're closest
        All you need is somebody to say
        It's okay not to be okay (ohh)
        It's okay not to be okay (no, no, no)
        When you're down and you feel ashamed
        (When you feel ashamed)
        It's okay not to be okay (no, no)
        It's okay not to be okay
         </p>
